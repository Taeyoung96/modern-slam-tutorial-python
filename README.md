# modern-slam-tutorial-python
- Learning and feeling SLAM together with hands-on-experiments :grinning: :smiley:	:laughing:

## Dependencies
- Most of the examples are based on GTSAM. use `$ pip install gtsam` and I prefer using conda environment. 
    - Also, I'll (want to) also use Pytorch to study recent differentiable factor-graph optimization works.
