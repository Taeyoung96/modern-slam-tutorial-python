sphere2500a [6] 
---------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o/tree/master/g2o/examples/sphere
Being a popular shape in robotics, there is another sphere2500 dataset generated by g2o (https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o/tree/master/g2o/examples/sphere) which is sometimes called sphere2500a. It is more connected than the iSAM sphere and thus more difficult to solve. There is however another sphere which was created by Giorgio Grisetti while implementing TORO in its 3D variant. It's called sphere_bignoise_vertex3.g2o and can be found inside the repository at http://www.openslam.org/g2o.html.
